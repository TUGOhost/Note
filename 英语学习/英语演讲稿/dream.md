I don’t know what that dream is that you have, I don’t care how disappointing it might have been as you’ve been working toward that dream, but that dream that you’re holding in your mind, that it’s possible!
Some of you already know, that it’s hard, it’s not easy, it’s hard changing your life. That in the process of working on your dreams you are going to incur a lot of disappointment, a lot of failure, a lot of pain. There are moments that you are going to doubt yourself. You said, God why is this happening to me? I’m just trying to take care of my family, trying to give them a good life, I’m not trying to steal or rob from anybody. Why does this have to happen to me. For those of you that have experienced some hardships – don’t give up on your dream.
The rough times are gonna come, but they have not come to stay, they have come to pass. Greatness, is not this wonderful, esoteric, illusive, God like feature that only the special among can achieve. It’s something that truly exists, in all of us. It’s very important for you to believe that you are the one!
Most people they raise a family, they earn a living and then they die. They stop growing, they stop working on themselves, they stop stretching, the stop pushing themselves. Then a lot of people like to complain but they don’t wanna do anything about their situation. And most people don’t work on their dreams – why? 
1. Is because of fear, fear of failure “what if things don’t work out“?
2. Is fair of success “what if they do and I can’t handle it?”
These are not risk takers
You have spent so much time with other people, you have spent so much time trying to get people to like you, you know other people more than you know yourself. You’ve studied them, you know about them, you want to hang out with them, you ·want to be just like them. You’ve invested so much time on them, you don’t know who you are. I challenge you to spend time by yourself.
It’s necessary, that you get the losers out of your life, if you want to live your dream. But people who are running towards their dreams, life has a special kind of meaning. When you become the ‘right-person’, what you do is you start separating yourself from other people you begin to have a certain uniqueness, as long as you follow other people, as long as you are being a ‘copy-cat’, you will never ever be the best copy-cat in the world but you will be the best you can be!
I challenge you to define your value.
Everybody won’t see it, everybody won’t join you, everybody won’t have the vision…it’s necessary to know that you are an uncommon breed. It’s necessary that you align yourself with people and attract people into your business, who are hungry, people who are unstoppable and unreasonable, people who are refusing to live life just as it is and who want more!
The people that are living their dreams are parting with winners, to attach themselves to the and the people who are living their dreams are the people that know that if it’s going to happen it’s up to them!
If you want to be more successful, if you want to have and do stuff you never done before then I’m asking you to invest in you!
Someones opinion of you does not have to become your reality.
You don’t have to go through life being a victim. And even though you face disappointments, you have to know within yourself that ‘I can do this, even if no one else sees it for me, I must see it for myself!’
No matter how bad it is, how hard it gets, say to yourself, I’m going to make it!
I wanna represent an idea. I wanna represent possibilities. Some of you right now, you wanna go to the next level. You wanna be a civil engineer, you wanna council, you wanna be a doctor.
Listen to me: You can’t get to that level. You can’t get to that level until you start to invest in your mind
I dare you to invest in your mind.
I dare you to invest time.
I dare you to be alone.
I dare you to spend an HOUR alone to get to know yourself.
I challenge you to get to a place where people do not like or do not even bother you anymore. Why? Because you’re not concerned with making them happy anyway. Because you’re trying to blow up. You’re trying to get to the next level. Because you’re investing in your mind.
If you’re still talking about your dream and your goals but you have not done anything just TAKE THE FIRST STEP.
You can make your parents proud, you can make your school proud you can touch millions of peoples lives and the world will never be the same again because you came this way. Don’t let anybody steal your dream!
After we face a rejection and a “no” or we have a meeting and no one shows up, or somebody says “you can count on me” and they don’t come through, what if we have that kind of attitude that cause reposes, nobody believes in you, you’ve lost again, and again, the lights are cut off but you are still looking at your dream, reviewing it everyday and saying to yourself: IT’S NOT OVER UNTIL I WIN!
You can live your dream!
